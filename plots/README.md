## Performance

The bar chart below shows, that the optimization process itself represents only a small fraction (<0.6%) of the computation time.
The 'No Opt'-bar shows the training time of a default Gradient-Boosting-Classifier normalized to 1. The other bars show the computation time relative to 'No Opt'. Each optimizer did 30 runs of 300 iterations, to get a good statistic.
