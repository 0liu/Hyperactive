# Hyperactive
A Python package for meta-heuristic hyperparameter optimization of scikit-learn models for supervised learning. Hyperactive automates the search for hyperparameters by utilizing metaheuristics to efficiently explore the search space and provide a sufficiently good solution. Its API is similar to scikit-learn and allows for parallel computation. Hyperactive offers a small collection of the following meta-heuristic optimization techniques:
  - Random search
  - Simulated annealing
  - Particle swarm optimization
