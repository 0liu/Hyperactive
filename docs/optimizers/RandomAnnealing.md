#### Random Annealing

An algorithm that chooses a new position within a large hypersphere around the current position. This hypersphere gets smaller over time.

###### Use case/properties:
- Disclaimer: I have not seen this algorithm before, but invented it myself. It seems to be a good alternative to the other random algorithms
- Good as a first method of optimization
- For a short optimization run to get an acceptable solution
