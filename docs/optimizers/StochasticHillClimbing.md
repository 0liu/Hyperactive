## Stochastic Hill Climbing
Stochastic hill climbing extends the normal hill climbing by a simple method against getting stuck in local optima. It has a parameter you can set, that determines the probability to accept worse solutions as a next position.

**Use case/properties:**
- Never as a first method of optimization
- When you have a very good initial point to start from
