## Hill Climbing

Hill climbing is a very basic optimization technique, that explores the search space only localy. It starts at an initial point, which is often chosen randomly and continues to move to positions with a better solution. It has no method against getting stuck in local optima.

#### Use case/properties:
- Never as a first method of optimization
- When you have a very good initial point to start from
- If the search space is very simple and has few local optima or saddle points
